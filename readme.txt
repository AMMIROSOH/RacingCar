Inputs = 3 neurons = BirdY, Bottom of top pipe, top of bottom pipe.

Outputs = one neuron = jump or not jump.
Activation Function = Tanh.
Population size of the birds = 100.
Fitness Function = distance the bird go #fintness function is actually how we choose the best networks to use for next 100.
Max Generation = 30 #if we reach 30 generation and we still dont have a good network the proccess should be re done
